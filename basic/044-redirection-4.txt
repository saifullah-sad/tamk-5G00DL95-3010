# Answer to exercise "4.4 Redirection 4"
#
# Anything with '#' is a comment.
# The answer appears in line(s) of their own.

# A: stdout to file.tmp, stderr to error.log  (OK)
# B: stderr to error.log, stdout to file.tmp  (OK)
# C: stdin redirected from non-existing file qwerty -> shell fails opening input, stderr goes to error.log (also an error message)
A and B save the error message to error.log; C also sends an error to error.log, but it fails before running cat.

# End of file
