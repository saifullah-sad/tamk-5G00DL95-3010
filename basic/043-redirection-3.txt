# Answer to exercise "4.3 Redirection 3"
#
# Anything with '#' is a comment.
# The answer appears in line(s) of their own.

# "echo 2" writes "2" to stdout.
# "2> 2" redirects stderr (fd 2) to file named "2".
# echo does not write anything to stderr here, so the file "2" remains empty.
echo 2 2> 2

# End of file
