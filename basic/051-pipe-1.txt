# Answer to exercise "5.1 Pipe 1"
#
"cat file | ls > file"
   ls does not read from stdin, so the output of cat is ignored.
   "> file" truncates file before ls runs, which may destroy its contents.

"ls | less > cat file"
   "less > cat file" is syntactically wrong.
   The shell treats "cat" as a filename for redirection, and "file" as an argument,
   so the pipeline does not work as intended.
#
# End of file
