# Answer to exercise "5.1 Pipe 1"
#
# Anything with '#' is a comment.
# The answer appears in line(s) of their own.

# (1) "cat file | ls > file" does not make practical sense: ls ignores stdin; also "> file" truncates file while cat reads it.
# (2) "ls | cat | less" works (cat is redundant but harmless).
# (3) "cat < file | less" works (input redirection is redundant but OK).
# (4) "ls | less > cat file" does not make sense: "less > cat" redirects less output to file named "cat"; then "file" is an argument, not a redirection target.

# End of file
