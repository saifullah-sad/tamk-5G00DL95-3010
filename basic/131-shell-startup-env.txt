# Answer to exercise "13.1 The Shell startup environment"
#
# Anything with '#' is a comment.
# The answer appears in line(s) of their own.

# Two variables:
# 1) PATH: search path for commands. Example usage:
#    export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
# 2) HISTSIZE: number of commands kept in memory history.
#    export HISTSIZE=5000
#
# Make permanent:
# Put the export lines into a startup file:
# - For interactive shells: ~/.bashrc
# - For login shells: ~/.profile (or ~/.bash_profile, depending on system)
#
# Example (append to ~/.bashrc):
# export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
# export HISTSIZE=5000

# End of file
