# Answer to exercise "4.6 Redirection 6"
#
# Anything with '#' is a comment.
# The answer appears in line(s) of their own.

# The shell sets up redirections before running ls:
# 1) "< ls" makes stdin read from file "ls" (empty file).
# 2) "> ls" opens/truncates file "ls" for stdout (empties it).
# Then ls runs; ls does not read stdin, so "< ls" is irrelevant.
# Output depends on directory contents, but it goes into file "ls".
# Risk: truncation happens first, so "ls" becomes empty before ls executes.
ls < ls > ls

# End of file
