# Answer to exercise "4.5 Redirection 5"
#
# Anything with '#' is a comment.
# The answer appears in line(s) of their own.

# "< /var/log/dpkg.log" redirects the file to stdin of "less".
# "less" reads from stdin when no filename is given.
# Result: you view the file content in less without naming the file as an argument.
< /var/log/dpkg.log less

# End of file
