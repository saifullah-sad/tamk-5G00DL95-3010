# Answer to exercise "7.3 Tar 1"
#
To create a package "~/package.tar.gz" by backing up everything under "~/tmp/" and its sub directories using Gzip compression algorithm, you can use the following command:
tar -czf ~/package.tar.gz -C ~ tmp
Explanation: tar is the archive utility, -c is create a new archive
-z is compress with gzip, -f ~/package.tar.gz means write an output to this file
-C ~ tmp is change directory to home first then include tmp.
You can check the contents by using tar -tzf ~/package.tar.gz
