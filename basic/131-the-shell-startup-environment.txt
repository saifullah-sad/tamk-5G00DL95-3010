Environment variables from bash:
1. EDITOR  
EDITOR defines the default text editor used when a program needs you to edit something (for example git, crontab, etc.).
To set it temporarily for nano:
export EDITOR=nano
To set it permanently:
echo 'export EDITOR=nano' >> ~/.bashrc
After that, restart the terminal or run:
source ~/.bashrc

2. PATH  
PATH is a list of directories that Bash searches to find executable programs. When you type commands like ls or python, Bash searches these directories in order.
To set it temporarily:
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
This adds your personal bin directory to the beginning of PATH.
To set it permanently:
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
After that, restart the terminal or run:
source ~/.bashrc

# End of file
