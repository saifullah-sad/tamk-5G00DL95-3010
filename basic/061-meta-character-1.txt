echo "The Result of this command is $(ls -la | wc -l) "
$(...) is command substitution. The shell executes the command inside it first.
"ls -la" lists all files in long format and sends the output to stdout.
The pipe "|" sends the stdout of ls to the stdin of "wc -l".
"wc -l" counts the number of lines it receives and outputs a number to stdout.
The shell replaces "$(ls -la | wc -l)" with that number.
echo prints the final string to stdout.
Output:The Result of this command is N
where N is the number of lines in the "ls -la" output.
#
# End of file
