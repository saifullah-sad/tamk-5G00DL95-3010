# Answer to exercise "2.1 Create directory structure"
#
First you would get into your wsl terminal or your linux terminal. Then, you would create a temp file if you don't have it already.
Then you can just run the command listed below:
mkdir -p some/dir1 some/dir2/doc1 some/dir2/doc2/test/more some/dir3/html
this wouldn't work if you didn't have -p. The -p stands for parent. This would make all the directories.
You can check if it worked by going to the parent directory "some" and running the command:
ls -R
or with the other command:
tree
